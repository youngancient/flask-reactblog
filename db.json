      "body": "React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality\nWritten in JavaScript—rendered with native code\nReact primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.\n\nMany platforms, one React. Create platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With React Native, one team can maintain multiple platforms and share a common technology—React.",

      "body": "A good framework choice for this blog could be Next.js or Gatsby. Both are ideal to make text-driven websites like blogs because they are server-rendered frameworks and give you better SEO. This is compared to a traditional client-rendered React app (one made with Create React App, for example).\n\nOur stack will consist of one of these React frameworks plus a transformer to convert our markdown content into HTML when our site is built. A good choice to transform our markdown content is the remark npm package.\n\nIf you want to make an even more impressive blog, with dynamic content, then you can consider using MDX. MDX is very similar to plain markdown, but it also allows you to include your own custom React components within the markdown.",

Eren Yeager has a particularly strong admiration for her, and displays signs of intense jealousy when other characters take too much of her attention.\n\nArmin Arlert is known to appreciate her beauty, courage, and strength, and considers her his closest friend. Sasha, being of the same age as Mikasa, is naturally enamored with her beauty and capabilities, and will occasionally compete with Eren for her attention.\n\nReiner Braun shows signs of affection for Mikasa and is constantly making excuses to be close to her. Others like Jean Kirstein also seem to have a thing for her, which sparks ridicule and a feeling of disdain from Eren.\n\nI love eren!!!",
